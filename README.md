# Dino Run Video Game
This enjoyable project was a collaborative effort for a school assignment we completed in just a few days. We also made the artwork, thanks to Lindsay's artistic skills. After the deadline, we revisited the project to refine our code. Due to the quick turnover, our guiding principle throughout was: "First get it working, then get it working right!"
## Steps Involved

## Future Steps
We hope to revamp this video game by adding the things we didn't have time for. This includes: 

1. Multiplayer functions
2. Increased player movement such as left and right
3. Add more obstacle types
