# Dino Run Video Game
This enjoyable project was a collaborative effort for a school assignment that we completed in just a couple of days. We also made the artwork, thanks to Lindsay's artistic skills. After the deadline, we revisited the project to refine our code. Due to the quick turnover, our guiding principle throughout was: "First get it working, then get it working right!"
