# Dino Run Video Game
This enjoyable project was a collaborative effort with a tight deadline, completed in just a few days. Lindsay's artistic skills contributed to the creation of original artwork. We hope to return and enhance our code. Given the rapid turnaround, our guiding principle was: "First, make it functional; then, make it flawless!" The game is a little dinosaur that changes colors when eating candies and jumps over obstacles. 
## Steps Involved
Lindsay was the driving creative force behind the project, responsible for conceiving the initial idea, crafting the artwork, and writing the main code. Corinne played a pivotal role in project management, bringing the creative ideas to fruition by creating bubble diagrams, structuring the code into classes, debugging, and ensuring flawless functionality. Together, we constituted an exceptional team.
## Future Steps
We intend to enhance this video game by incorporating elements that we couldn't include initially. We organized the code with scalability in mind. This enhancement will encompass:

Implementing multiplayer functions.
Expanding player movement capabilities, including left and right directions.
Introducing additional types of obstacles.
